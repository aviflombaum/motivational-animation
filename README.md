# Motivational Animation

## Introduction

## Part 1. HTML

First open `index.html`. You will be adding code to that file.

Find the HTML comment `<!-- Part 1: HTML -->` and get ready to insert your code below.

Your goal is to add a `UL` tag along with some `LI` tags nested inside the `UL` that contain your messages. For example:

```html
<ul>
  <li>The first message</li>
  <li>The second message</li>
</ul>
```

The next thing you need to do is add an `HTML Attribute` to the `UL` to give it a `class` of `messages`. Only when the `UL` has a `class` of `messages`, will the page animate.

```html
<ul class="messages">
  <li>The first animated message.</li>
  <li>The second animated message.</li>
</ul>
```
